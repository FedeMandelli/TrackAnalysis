# TrackAnalysis
This repository contains the software associated with the Doctoral thesis of Manuela Carnaghi 2022 "LANDING AND POST-LANDING BEHAVIOUR OF HOST-SEEKING MALARIA VECTOR, ANOPHELES COLUZZII, IN RESPONSE TO HOST-ASSOCIATED CUES".

This code is written for Python 3.9 and all the relative dependencies are stored in `requirements.txt`

This code is not actively maintained.

## Description
TrackAnalysis is a set of custom scripts that analyse the flight of mosquitoes.

Given a csv file with a list of points in a 3D plane (X,Y,Z) representing a path (in the specific case, the flight of a
mosquito), the different scripts will output different analysis, among which for example:
- time of flight
- linear distance in any axes
- 3D distance
- speed
- special analysis in a given 3D space
- heatmaps representing the data
- 3D plot of the track

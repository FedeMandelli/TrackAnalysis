# TrackAnalysis

## Description
TrackAnalysis is a set of custom scripts to analyse the flight of mosquitoes.

Given a csv file with a list of points in a 3D plane (X,Y,Z) representing a path (in the specific case, the flight of a
mosquito), the different scripts will output different analysis, such as:
- time of flight
- linear distance in any axes
- 3D distance
- speed
- special analysis in a given 3D space
- heatmaps representing the data
- 3D plot of the track
